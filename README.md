## Working with the Project

To collaborate on the QGIS plugin:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kan-T-IT/QGIS-KICa.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd QGIS-KICa
   ```

3. Create a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Install pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```


7. Update the path to your QGIS plugin directory:

   * In QGIS, go to: `Settings > User Profiles > Open Active Profile Folder`.
   * Then go to: `python/plugins`.

   Update this path in the following files:

   * `deploy.sh`: modify the `PLUGIN_DIR` variable.
   * `src/pb_tool.cfg`: update the `plugin_path` value.

### Plugin Deployment

The `deploy.sh` script automates the following tasks:

* Compiling UI templates
* Compiling resource files
* Copying files to the QGIS plugins folder
* Creating a ZIP file in the `/dist` directory

**Note:** Ensure the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
```
